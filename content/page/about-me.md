I am a software developer living in Melbourne, Australia.

I always liked pushing buttons as a kid. I was excited by a look of complex machines with lots of buttons and blinking lights I saw on TV. When I saw a real computer the first time, I was blown away. It was an [ATARI 2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) arcade machine, and I ended up blowing all my pocket money playing it regularly. When I got my own computer for a birthday, I was super excited. Now suddenly I could play games at home! After a short time, just playing games became boring. I taught myself programming. First BASIC, then Assembler and Pascal. And started creating. That’s how I got hooked up, and I have remained ever since.

My core professional specialities are front-end web development and Oracle database, but my experience is much wider, and my interests are as broad as the technology universe itself. After many years I am still passionate about technology, and I never stop learning.

## What My Co-workers say about me

<blockquote>
<p>While managing Sergey, I found him to be a breath of fresh air. So many people claim to know their trade, but don&rsquo;t quite live up to their promises. Sergey doesn&rsquo;t make such claims, but surely did deliver and far more than I ever expected.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Sergey was a valuable member of my team who I could assign complex tasks to, knowing that he would get them delivered. He was able to achieve this by reviewing and analysing the requirements to understand what exactly the business unit required. Sergey's technical skills enable him to provide high-quality work with accurate results, on time delivery and within estimates.</p>
