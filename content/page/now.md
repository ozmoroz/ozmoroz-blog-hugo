Here is what currently occupy my days.

## At work

My contract at [Officeworks](https://officeworks.com.au) has ended. I am looking for a new challenge.

## At home

- I am getting excited about the <a href="/tags/esk8.html">electric skateboarding</a>.
- I am building [a new quadcopter]({{<ref "post/Armattan-tilr-r-part-1-the-beginning.md">}}) based on [Armattan Tilt-R](http://www.armattanquads.com/armattan-tilt-r/) frame. It will have the full autopilot features and capable of aerobatics.
- Studying. I enrolled in [30x500 Academy](https://30x500.com/academy/) and slowly working my way through.
- The books I'm reading: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed-ebook/dp/B00BAXFJ16">Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed</a> by Alexis Ohanian, [Crysis: Legion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IPP8UA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by  Peter Watts. I am a sucker for good science fiction.
