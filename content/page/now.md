Here is what currently occupy my days.

## At work

I am working at [Officeworks](https://officeworks.com.au) as a contract Front-end developer (React.js + ES6). My present engagement is until the end of February 2018.

- I am working on a front-end of <a href="https://www.officeworks.com.au/campaigns/business-computing">Business Computing platform</a>. It allows businesses to lease office equipment from Officeworks and subscribe to managed printing services.
- The <a href="https://www.officeworks.com.au/campaigns/back-to-school/school-list-service">School List Service</a>, for which I developed the front-end, is now live! Parents can now order school supplies online via a simple web app

## At home

- I am getting excited about the <a href="/tag/esk8.html">electric skateboarding</a>.
- <s>Whenever possible, I'm flying <a href="/tag/multirotors.html">my custom-built Alien 560 drone</a>.</s><br/>
[I crashed my Alien 560 quadcopter](https://youtu.be/SFSsMt6lBdg). [Thinking about a new build]({{<ref "post/Armattan-tilr-r-part-1-the-beginning.md">}}).
