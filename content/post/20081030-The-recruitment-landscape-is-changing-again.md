A few days ago I went to a presentation by an Oracle recruiter. He
talked about the ways Oracle searches for the potential candidates and
and hires them. One particular thing that struck me was that Australian
Oracle recruitment team does not use specialised recruitment web sites.

About a decade ago, looking for a job was all about reading newspaper
ads. Then along came job web sites, and the recruitment landscape
changed forever.

I am myself of a younger generation, and looking for a job for me was
never associated with newspapers. When I look for a job, I go to a web
sites such as [Seek](https://seek.com.au/) or
[Monster.com](https://www.monster.com/) and search there. I take it as a given
that all the jobs I may be interested in are posted there, either
directly of through recruitment agents.
This approach is more convenient for both job advertisers and seekers,
because it allows them to find each other more easily. And most of the
activity is concentrated around a few dominant players such as
aforementioned Seek and Monster. This is because of so-called
__network effect__: such web sites are
created to connect people to each other, in our case job seekers and
advertisers, and because the number of possible connections is
proportional to the square of participants, the probability of "getting
connected" through a large job web site is much higher than through a
small one. Thus, size does matter. Indeed, if I want to find a job,
the first thing I do is look at the largest local job site because this
is where most jobs are, much like [Willie Sutton](https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/sutton/sutton.htm) robbing banks "Because that's where the money is".

But that is changing too.

As I have already said, I was surprised to hear that Australian Oracle
recruiters do not use job web sites. Instead, they exploit a relatively
new phenomenon of Internet [social network services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service).

Social networks benefit from network effect at the scale of magnitude
comparing to the traditional job sites. This is because the network size
of job sites depend on the number of job advertisers paying for placing
their ads. In other words, id depends on _supply_ of ads. And if supply side
does not increase, the network will not grow.

On the other hand, the growth rate of a social network is not limited by
either supply or demand. As long as new members keep subscribing,
network will grow. Even if they stop, the existing members will still be
able to establish new connections until all the members are connected to
each other.

A good example is [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/), which is
effectively a tool for building a professional social network. It allows
you to easily find your co-workers, provided they are registered with
the site, as well as connect with potential employers.

So, what is there for employers? The benefit for them is that they are
able to build their network, even if they are not actively hiring. And
after that, when they need it, they will be able to instantly find the
right candidates through their connections. It is like having a job
seekers bank at their disposals, a readily available database of resumes. And
that bank will update and grow by itself.

That leads us to an interesting conclusion: within this new paradigm if
you're not online, you cannot be found. And if you cannot be found, you
can't be hired. Just because you are outside of the network.

All in all, we are witnessing a birth of a new recruitment methods. Who
knows where it is going to lead us. Maybe in 5 years it will be mandatory for job seekers to have a [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) avatar
and all the interviews will be conducted in virtual reality.
