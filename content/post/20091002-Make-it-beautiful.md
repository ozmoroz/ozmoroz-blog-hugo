You only need a single look at Sydney Opera House to recognise that it
is a work of art. Any masterpiece is like that – you don't need to do a
throughout examination of Mona Lisa's smile to realise its beauty – you
see it instantly. Perfection needs no explanation, it works on
subconscious level.

The same applies to the software engineering too. Great code always
looks good. It is always carefully formatted, indented and commented. By
just looking at it you can tell that it is a work of art. Such code will
always work, do what it is supposed to do and have a very few bugs.
Because whoever wrote that code cared a lot about it. And you can safely
assume that if anyone has put a lot of effort into making the code
looking good, he has put at least as much effort into designing and
debugging it.

What is even more important, carefully carved code is easier to
maintain. In modern software projects any single procedure gets tweaked
and rewritten tens of times. If you are a programmer, good chances that
even in a project that you work on right now you inherited some code
that was written years ago, maybe from people who long left the company.
And when you finish with it, it will not be the end of the story – the
code will be passed to QA and finally to the production support. And
then the cycle will start again. Hence, whatever you program, it's not
just about you. You don't know how many people will be looking into your
code trying to make sense of it. And you can help them immensely by
making it is easy to read and understand now. Whether you will be
remembered as a good programmer or cursed depends on it.

So, you made an effort to write the code that works. Now make an extra
step – make it beautiful.
