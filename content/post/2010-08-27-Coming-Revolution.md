Soon a small black box will enter our living rooms, and that will
change the way we spend time in front of TVs forever.  It will
happen on Nov. 4, 2010, and the name of this phenomenon is Kinect.

In my student days I was an avid gamer and has played virtually all
"big" games that came out for  PC, luckily for me those days it
wasn't such a flood as now. And I remember well the events that
changed the game industry as we knew it. Those milestones were:

-   Doom - the first popular first-person shooter, 1993;
-   3dfx Voodoo - the first 3D accelerator, 1996;
-   Nvidia GeForce 256 - the first 3D accelerator with integrated
    geometry GPU, 1999.

After that, I stopped actively playing games did not follow the gaming
news. And returning sporadically into the game world I was discovering
that nothing actually has changed. Well, the resolution was higher,
graphics better and explosions more colourful. But the gameplay still
remained the same - defined by Doom at the beginning of 90s. Of the
remarkable events only the release of Nintendo Wii in 2006 comes to
mind, which changed our perception of computer games. They were no
longer something available only to nerds. Now the whole family could
play and, more importantly, while moving rather than sitting
still.  Perhaps it was then, when Microsoft saw that and decided
to take the idea to a new level.

Kinect is a small box connected to the Xbox 360. It has 2 cameras that
watch the player, detect the position of his body and movement, and
thereby enable you to control events on the screen. Motion Control in
a pure form – simple and brilliant. No controllers, no wires. According
to Microsoft's statements, one Kinect can completely digitise
movements of  two players and track the positions of four more. The players
may be standing or sitting. In addition, Kinect has multi-array
microphone through which it can recognise the voice of his "master"
and obey his orders.

Microsoft presented Kinect a year ago at E3 exhibition, then it carried
the working title "Project Natal". And immediately it was clear that
it would be a revolution, if only Microsoft would be able to deliver on
promises. Now, when Kinect is very close to the release, Microsoft has
distributed sample devices to leading gaming magazines. And now we can
say firmly - Microsoft succeeded. According to the lucky ones who
played with Kinect, watching first time the character on the screen
waiving its hands in coordination with you movements is fascinating.
Motion Control is not perfect, but still very good.

This is what a gameplay with Kinect looks like:

I predict that Kinect will be a huge hit. It along with the new Xbox
360 will take the market by storm. Potential customers will have to
stand in a queue for hours to buy it. And for some time after launch
it will not be possible just to walk into a store and buy one, as it is
now impossible to buy an iPhone 4. Neither Sony, nor Nintendo has
anything comparable.

So, we are on the eve of the revolution. Now it is the turn of gaming
companies  to help us fully explore this bright new world.
