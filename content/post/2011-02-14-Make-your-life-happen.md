[Jason Fitzpatrick](http://lifehacker.com/people/jfitzpatrick/) left [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com). Here's what he has to say:

> The only commodity we have is time. Somewhere — in your mind, on a notepad, stashed
in a virtual notebook — you have a list of things you'd like to be doing with your
time before it all slips away. Do what
you have to do to take those ideas out of storage and make them happen. You can
trade and barter for a lot in life but you can never buy back time. Go live.
