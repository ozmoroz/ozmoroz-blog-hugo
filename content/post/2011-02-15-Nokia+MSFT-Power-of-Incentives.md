Considering that the present Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop is one of the
largest individual shareholders of Microsoft, no wonder [they tied a
knot](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/nokia-and-microsoft-team-up-suffering-together-merging-to-survive/8152).

{{<figure src="/images/2011-02-15_elop_msft.png" alt="Stephen Elop: 130,026 Microsoft shares" caption="Source:" attr="dailyfinance.com" attrlink="http://www.dailyfinance.com/company/microsoft-corporation/msft/nas/institutional-ownership">}}

And it's not a surprise he [tries to talk the Nokia's share price
down](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fconversations.nokia.com%2F2011%2F02%2F14%2Fstephen-elops-nokia-press-conference-at-mwc%2F&rct=j&q=nokia%20bad%20position%20elop&ei=ip5dTY_sEYbJceeT3e8J&usg=AFQjCNE7GvdOaiZXODpUtb0aU6DP-uI7cw&sig2=0g4rBsyeJHzPFy7FHquxsw&cad=rja).
He doesn't currently have any Nokia shares, but [he will have to buy
some soon](http://mynokiablog.com/2011/02/13/nokia-ceo-elop-to-buy-nokia-shares-asap-to-divest-microsoft-shares-soon/).
And the cheaper Nokia shares are, the less he will pays for them.

As [Charlie Munger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger) puts it:

> ‘I think I’ve been in the top 5% of my
age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and
all my life I’ve underestimated it. And never a year passes but I get
some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther.’
