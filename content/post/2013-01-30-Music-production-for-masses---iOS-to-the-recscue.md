Some time ago [I wrote](../../2012/09/cost-and-comlexity-of-making-electronic.html)
my thoughts on the modern state of PC music-making applications.
In the nutshell, I reckon that niche became too overpriced and
overcomplicated. All the existing digital audio workstations are
targeted towards professional users, with the price tags to match. At
the same time, the area of casual music production remains a no-manâ€™s
land.

Since then I got an iPad and discovered that simple and cheap music apps
which I missed so much are plentiful there. I am excited about the
emerging phenomenon of music production on iOS. There are already
all-in-one DAWs for iOS such as
[NanoStudio](http://blipinteractive.co.uk/) and
[BeatMaker2](http://www.intua.net/products/beatmaker2), and even
multitrack recording DAWs such as
[Auria](http://auriaapp.com/Products/auria). Moreover, while virtual
synths for PCs & Macs cost circa $100 or more on average, synths of
comparable quality for iOS are about 5 times cheaper. If you doubt, take
a look at [AniMoog](http://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/animoog-0),
[WaveGenerator,](http://wolfgangpalm.com/?p=595) or
[nLogSynth](http://www.temporubato.com/).

Since its appearance the iOS music scene is expanding rapidly. Large
companies start to realize that iPad is not just a toy, and the recent
inflow of software from [Korg](http://www.korg.com/ipolysix),
[Moog](http://www.moogmusic.com/products/Apps),
[Akai](http://akaiprompc.com/impc/), and the most recent,
[Steinberg](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/ios_apps/cubasis.html)
and
[Yamaha](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/apps/mobile_sequencer/?mode=model)
is the proof of that.

Indeed, I reckon we are witnessing a rise of a new music making
platform. The platform which is simple and accessible enough for
beginners yet has a potential to become powerful enough for
professionals.
