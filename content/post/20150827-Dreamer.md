This isn’t a new song. I wrote it 3 years ago as an assignment for Berklee's Online [Composing and Producing Electronic Music](http://online.berklee.edu/courses/composing-and-producing-electronic-music-1) course.
It is heavily influenced by Robert Miles, one of my favourite trance artists. Here it is, “Dreamer”:
