[Jim Sinegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sinegal), co-founder and former CEO of Costco, is one of the most influential business leaders of our time. [Motley Fool]( http://www.fool.com/) recently recorded an interview with him, ["Costco’s Winning Formula"]( http://fool.libsyn.com/costcos-winning-formula). The whole conversation is packed with wisdom. But one quote caught my particular attention:
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself involved in something that you don’t truly love and feel passionate about, run, don’t walk, to the fastest exit and get out of there and get yourself involved in something you truly can become passionate about. Because if you do that, you’ll never have to work another day in your life.</p>
