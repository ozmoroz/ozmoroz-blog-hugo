It’s been nearly a year since I wrote that post: [A new chapter](../../2015/09/a-new-chapter.html). During that time I did a bit of traveling, spent a fair amount of time slacking off at the beach (you can’t resist that during summer time in Australia), but most of all I was studying. I was keen to deliver on my resolution to pick up lasting fundamental skills.

As I already [had an experience with online education](../../2012/07/composing-and-producing-electronic.html) and found it as good, if not better, than in-person training, I went for online courses again. There is no shortage of opportunities for online learning for anyone who wants to pick up new skills, especially in technology: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com), just to name a few, provide lots on online courses covering a wide variety of technologies. Most of them are very affordable or even free. I listened to a few lectures on [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/) before, however I never took them seriously. And just when I was deciding what to learn next, an email arrived into my mailbox advertising a brand new [Full Stack Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack). In Coursera’s lingo, a specialization is a sequence of related courses which progress you to a particular goal, in this case – becoming a full stack developer, i.e. a developer who is capable of creating both back-end and front-end sides of a software solution, in this instance in JavaScript. That specialization was advertised to include the following courses:

* [HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript)
* [Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-frameworks)
* [Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/angular-js)
* [Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hybrid-mobile-development)
* [Server-side Development with NodeJS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development)

and an optional [capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-development-project), where students could apply the newly acquired skills to build a real-world software product.

Although I already knew some of these topics, I decided to enroll for that specialization anyway. After all, reiterating the fundamentals never hurts. A part of [my resolution](../../2015/09/a-new-chapter.html) was to acquire fundamental skills which do not depend on a single vendor. And **the web** is as fundamental as they get. The web is everywhere, it has become **the application platform**, and web frontend has become **the front-end**. I agree with [Atwood’s Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/), stating that "*any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript*". Over the years I’ve watched the meteoric rise of JavaScript from the sidelines wishing I could make a career turn and concentrate on that brave new world. Well, now I had a chance.

Before I've got stuck in the Oracle swamp, I used to build UI applications. That was what I did well and enjoyed doing. At those old times, UI meant C++ with MFC, Delphi, Visual Basic, or some similar old tools no one can recall now. And since I decided to take a career turn, I wanted to get back to UI. But since UI now universally means web applications, I had to become an expert in web development. I took a plunge and enrolled for the Coursera’s specialization.

The next few months were intense. At first I thought I could learn at a leisurely pace at Coursera, and if I’m bored I’ll pick up some other courses to do at the same time. But instead, I found that Coursera’s stuff was full-on. I had to watch the lectures, read a lot of supplementary materials, do assignments and turn them in each week. And because I wanted to obtain an in-depth understanding of how everything worked, I was studying nearly full time. Then I had to verify other people’s assignments – Coursera has a peer-to-peer assessment model, where each student has to grade assignments of 3 other students each week. That is clever, and I found that I learned as much from other student’s fork as from my own study.

In the middle of the second course I was doing, Coursera suddenly changed its business model. It used to be all free for everyone. Now anyone who wanted to get assessed and graded had to pay. I still could watch all the lectures for free, but my assignments wouldn’t be graded and I wouldn’t get the course completion certificate. After some consideration I chose to pay – it wasn’t that much anyway.

To cut a long story short, that was quite a ride. Now when it is all behind me, I wholeheartedly recommend that specialization to anyone willing to learn about web development. You may take all of its courses to learn everything you need to know to become front-end or back-end web developer, or pick individual courses to suit your learning needs. Either way, it is an excellent value for your time and your money.

In a few days after I finished the last course and updated my resume, I had a new job as a front-end web developer. It is a new direction for me, a new road ahead. I like it, I think I’ll stay on it for a while.
