[Jay Boston](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmVDOR335x8ifxlu_5_Sw) invited me on his live show to talk about my experience with FPV drones.

It is a long conversation. We go deep into a range topics:

- What FPV drones are. What makes them different from consumer drones such as DJI.
- How to start with FPV.
- Different classes of FPV drones.
- Analogue vs digital FPV systems.
- What equipment you need to fly FPV drones. What to buy and where to buy it.
- Where to find more information about FPV.
- Safety of FPV flying.
- Rules and regulations of FPV flying.
