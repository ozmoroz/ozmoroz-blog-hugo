Another tech talk that struck me deeply - ["Scaling Down" by Aslam Khan](https://youtu.be/zk7gRFLaH0w) at Beauty in Code 2020 conference. It is about architecture complexity and domain complexity.

We have a tendency to overcomplicate things when that complexity is not warranted. That is a trap that s very hard to find a way out.

One of the quotes he had in his presentation which struck me was:

A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.
