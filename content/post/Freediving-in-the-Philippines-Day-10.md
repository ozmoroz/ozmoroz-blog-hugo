Summary: We are visiting Badian Island Resort.

Surprisingly, I did not have a hangover next morning. Either I did not
drink as much as I thought I did, or the quality of the local rum was
much better than I expected. Therefore I, as usual, appeared by the
pool of Club Serena at 10 a.m.

We had a depth diving scheduled for the morning. A buoy was put right
beyond the reef for us, and those few people who were able after the
previous day's celebration swam to it, accompanied by Julia. To be
honest, I did not want to dive deeply on that day. Although I still
wanted to know what I was capable of and knew that I hadn't reached my
limit, somehow I was sure I wouldn't dive deeper than I already did
during that stay. And besides, my ear started to ache. Earache is an
occupational illness for all depth divers. The combination of cold sea
water and high pressure does its work, and a diver is prone to picking
up ear infections. The nearest doctor was three hours away, so I
decided to wait until I got home to Melbourne.

We started to dive in turns, but apparently everybody was worn out. I
dived to 22 meters. It was a good result for me, and it showed that I
could dive to 20+ meters pretty comfortably. Although I did not beat
my previous record on that day, I was OK with it. Everything has its
place and time, and I knew I would have another opportunity sooner or later.

Furthermore, I began to realise what was holding me back. It wasn't the
pressure – even at 26 meters I could successfully equalise pressure in
my ears and I felt no chest compression. That is, I could go deeper.
But I was getting out of breath. Also, I just didn't have the proper
equipment. My Mares Volo Race fins were good for swimming, and they
proved to be excellent for underwater hockey. But still they were very
soft and not made for freediving. They simply did not give the
necessary propulsion. The first stage during a deep dive, when you
have to overcome your own buoyancy together with the resistance of water,
is very important. And you will need all the power your fins can develop.
The monofin, of course, is the most effective in this case. Especially
the so-called "hyperfin" – almost all of our experienced guys had
them. "Hypers" have a different foot pocket design. In them, the heel is
raised above the surface of the blade to compensate for the relative
weakness of the ankle muscles. This is uncomfortable but effective.
"Hypers" are sold in many countries, but manufactured mainly in
Russia. They have already revolutionised the fin swimming sport and now almost
completely conquered the world of freediving. Fins made of carbon
fibre or glass fibre are also very efficient, whereas my fins, made of
rubber and plastic, were not as good.

Besides, I was plainly freezing. As I mentioned earlier, my own open
cell wetsuit was too warm for the tropical waters of the Philippines,
while the borrowed 3mm steamer, as it turned out, was too cold. The
problem was not even that the wetsuit itself was thin, but that the
cold seawater could freely pour under the collar, cancelling out all
the thermal insulation provided by the rubber. There are suits with
tricky zippers, in which this problem is solved. Next time, if I won't
be able to find an appropriate open cell suit, I will at least get one
like that. As I said before, in between dives freedivers lie still on
the surface of water with little or no movement. Those were the
moments when I was freezing. I had to twitch my arms and legs to warm up, and
as a result I could not relax.

That morning I was not the only one who was freezing; and after diving
for an hour, we returned to the shore. After dinner we settled upon
going to another reef, where Julia wanted to film for her TV project.
Since I was getting cold in the water, I decided to try to dive in my
own open cell wetsuit. The reef turned out to be very close to the place where we were diving to the plane. Once we arrived, the preparations for the filming
started. The theme was musical. The guys fetched out a violin and a
guitar. The guitar was bought here on the island a few days earlier. I
saw it before, but couldn't guess what kind of fate awaited it. The
guitar was a key part of the script. However, getting it underwater
turned out to be not easy. The guitar was too buoyant and it took a
2-pound weight to sink it. I pulled on my wetsuit and plunged into the
water. And then I was up for a big surprise.

When I had dived in the borrowed steamer, I attached a 2 kg weight to
the belt to offset its buoyancy, and that was enough. I knew that my
open cell wetsuit was more buoyant, and put 3 kg of weight on the
belt. Turned out, that was not enough! I could dive with great difficulty –
the suit kept me on the surface. So I had to go back to the boat and
fasten one more weight. That helped a little, but still was not
enough. Unfortunately, I didn't have any more weights. Furthermore, the suit
was clearly too thick for tropical waters, and I was getting hot.
Meanwhile, a few meters below the surface the underwater concert was
in a full swing. The show was really beautiful; and maybe we will see the
video one day. However, I soon realised that my clumsy figure could
accidentally get on camera so I preferred to wander off. Since I
couldn't really dive because of my buoyancy, and I was getting hot, I
soon returned to the boat, pulled the suit off, and just relaxed and
waited for the rest of the guys to return. It was not my day.

We had yet another trip planned for the evening. We booked a dinner at
a prestigious hotel, Badian Island Resort. Julia stayed at that resort
with friends on the previous New Year's Eve and loved it. That resort
is on a separate tiny island, and usually only the resort's guests are
allowed there. But we boldly introduced ourselves as a team of tour
operators from Moscow, and they made an exception for us. For a modest
fee of 1500 pesos (around $30) we were promised a tour, a buffet
dinner, and an entertainment program.

It was already dark when we set off. From our hotel we had to ride 40
minutes by car to the pier, and then travel for another 10 minutes on
a boat to that island. Once we disembarked from the boat, we were
welcomed by girls from the Badian Resort's staff. They presented each
of us a necklace made of flowers and asked us to walk over to the
reception. There we were asked to pay upfront. Then the tour followed.
The problem with the tour was that it was already completely dark, and
we couldn't see anything. Nevertheless, we were shown around the
island. Despite the pitch black, it was obvious that Badian was an
exclusive resort for the rich, where the number of staff exceeded the
number of guests. Massage rooms and spas with baths covered with rose
petals were all around. At one place a cascade of personal swimming
pools was arranged so that occupants could lie on special couches
(yes, right in the pool) while watching the sunset. After some time, since
we could not see anything anyway, we were shown directly to the area
around the main pool, where the dinner tables were set up. I have to
admit that the dinner was delicious.However, we soon found out that
drinks were not included into the price we paid. In front of me at the
table stood a bottle of red Australian wine – Hardy's. I asked how
much it was. Having received the answer, I converted it into Australian
dollars, and it turned out that the price was about three times more
than I would pay in Australia. I decided to pass with Hardy's and
ordered a glass of a house red instead. In the meantime, we were all
looking forward to the show.

For those 10 days while we were in the Philippines, we didn't see any
manifestation of the local culture. And we were very interested to
hear and see some local songs and dances, something ethnically Filipino. On
the other side of the pool, where a small stage was installed, two men
with guitars appeared sometime later and started singing. They sang in
an unfamiliar language, perhaps one of the Filipino languages. When
they finished, lights turned on over the lawn next to the stage. Music
started playing, and a group of dancers in ethnic costumes ran out
onto that impromptu dance stage. I can not say that they danced badly, on
the contrary – it looked very nice. It just didn't feel like Filipino
dancing. Rather, it was entertainment for foreigners, folk dancing to
Western music.

![The folk dance show](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1xcnG6W37qg/S5t6sW6Zj2I/AAAAAAAADA8/0lDxqPucWvA/s960-Ic42/SDC11871.JPG "The folk dance show")
<div class="caption">The folk dance show</div>

They danced a few numbers and even tried to lure us into a dance and,
to some extent, succeeded. After them a man with a guitar came to our
table and started singing. He sang a very sad and very long song in an
unfamiliar language. It is unclear why he decided that this song was
perfectly suited to this moment. For the first few minutes we endured
that. Then someone offered to give him money to go away. After a few
more minutes we couldn't take it anymore, and one after another
started fleeing from the table. Finally he finished his song and left. After
that an elderly Caucasian man walked to our table.He turned out to be
the hotel's owner himself. He greeted us on behalf of the resort and
presented a free drink for everyone, which slightly warmed our Russian
souls. And then the entertainment continued, presented by the already
familiar Filipino "Simon and Garfunkel" and dance revue. The man with
a guitar didn’t come back, thank God.

When the entertainment program was over, we decided that we ate and
drank enough, and made for our hotel. But we had a discussion and
decided that, as "tour operators", we would not recommend that place
to our clients. Maybe it's good for wealthy retirees, but personally we
liked the hotels we stayed in much better.

When we returned to Club Serena and I, having opened the bus's door,
set my foot on the ground, I saw a tall Caucasian man waiting for us.

“Is one of you Sergey?” he asked. “I am Michael, the owner of ’Blue
Orchid’".
