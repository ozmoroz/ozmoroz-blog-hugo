The story of this day will not be as long as the previous ones. We
didn't dive on Day 5. Instead, we went canyoning.

Kawasan Falls are located about 20 minutes away by car from our hotels.
It is a cascade of one large and two smaller waterfalls. We were told
they looked quite spectacular. But just going sightseeing wasn't our
intent. Instead, we drove about half an hour higher into the
mountains. From there, we were going to walk to the falls. Canyoning means
descending down a river. Not on rafts, but on feet. That is, it is
literally walking down the bed of a mountain river. Our team was led,
once again, by local instructor Wolfgang, for whom organising such
routes is a part of his business. He told us that the route was very
simple, and even children who could not swim would walk through it.
Wolfgang announced that in some places we'd have to jump from small
ledges into the water and swim. It did not scare anybody. All present
were freedivers, and therefore people of steel, capable of diving down
tens of meters on a single breath. However, after just 10 minutes we
came to the cliff, which ended with a five-meter drop with a rocky
pool at the bottom. Wolfgang declared that we had to jump.

Most of us were brave enough, and after a few moments of hesitation, we
one by one stepped over the ledge and plunged into the river below.
However, a few girls were not inclined to jump. Those who already did
it tried to cheer up the doubters and convince them that there wasn't
really anything scary. It took some, but finally they took a leap of
faith, and we moved on. Fortunately for us, that was the largest
challenge we faced. For the next three or four hours we hiked down the
river. For most of the way the path led us along its banks, but in
some places the path was blocked, and we had to march right upon the river
bed. Besides, it was a hot day, and stomping upon the water was more
fun. Several times we stopped to rest and wait for stragglers. For
most of the way the river was about knee-deep or less. But in a few places
along our way it formed pools which were quite deep. In such places we
had to jump into the water and swim, as Wolfgang promised us, for
there was no other way around.

Finally we reached the first waterfall just to discover that is was
quite small, just a few meters high. I even thought in disappointment:
"Is that all?" But it turned out that it was just the beginning. Ten
minutes later we approached the second waterfall, which was a little
bigger. And after yet another 10 minutes hiking down the path we saw
the third one. And it was indeed a sight worth seeing. Water was
thundering down from 20-meter height and like a white shower falling
into the lake at the bottom.

However, the magnificent view was just a part of the attraction. At the edge of the lake a couple of rafts were parked. The rafts were made from thick stalks of bamboo bound together with ropes. Our team, accompanied by two local guides, boarded one of the rafts.

One of the guides instructed us to sit down, and then started to pull
our raft to the waterfall by means of a clever system of ropes
stretched over the lake. But instead of heading for the waterfall
directly, the guides directed the rafts into a narrow cave a few
meters away. They ordered us to lie down. Everyone obeyed, and soon we
understood why that was necessary: as the rafts were moving farther
into the cave, the ceiling began to decline and stayed as low as half
a meter above the water. There was barely enough room for us to lie
down.

The guide continued to pull our raft forward, and in another few meters
we made a sharp turn. The cave suddenly ended and we saw a white wall
of water in front of us – we emerged beyond the waterfall. The guide
gave us permission to get up, everybody jumped to his feet, and soon
we entered the waterfall.

The stream of water falling on my shoulders from 20-meter height was an
unforgettable sensation. That was like a very hard shower, which
burned and cooled at the same time. The raft stopped so that the water
curtain divided it exactly in half. We were jumping back and forth through the
stream, shouting in wild voices and laughing. Then our guide pulled
the raft out from under the waterfall and asked whether we wanted more.
All shouted that they did, and the raft once again was directed to the
entrance to the cave, and we went through the waterfall over again.
And when it was over, we rested at the local restaurant located next to
the waterfall, had a delicious lunch, and drank rum. Everyone was tired
but happy.

Upon returning to Club Serena, I headed directly to my hotel, because
all of us were very tired and I knew that that was all for that day.

**The end of the fifth day.**
