Having arrived, as usual, at 10 a.m. after breakfast at Club Serena, I
found that almost everyone was so exhausted after the previous day's
march, that even the morning yoga hadn't happened. A bit later the
people slowly began to crawl together to the pool area, complaining of
pain in various limbs.

Our spearfishers, once again, went hunting early in the morning. And
for the rest of us, at least for those who were able to, a static
breath-holding session was planned. As always, it all started with
breathing. We gathered at a gazebo on the beach and under Julia's
supervision did some breathing exercises for about half an hour. Then
Julia told us to disperse, to sit somewhere in a more comfortable
position and do a few breathing cycles on ourselves, then to make a
single breath-hold on land. After that we suited up and got into the
pool.

Just like the last time, we placed ourselves in the water near the side
of the pool and started breathing up. Then Julia gave a command to
make the last six deep breaths and begin when ready. Having lowered my face
into the water, I mentally walked through the entire body to make sure
that absolutely all the muscles were relaxed: from the toes up to the
waist, up the spine, neck, up facial muscles and jaw, and arms to the
tips of my fingers. Then tried to calm down my thoughts and just float
still on the surface...

Many say that they do not like to do static. On the contrary, I enjoy
it. The relaxation, which comes with it, is unlike anything else. I am
suspended in the water completely relaxed. My body weighs nothing.
Beneath me and above me – infinity. My thoughts are far away. I do not
need to care about anything, don't even need to breathe. My heart beat
slows down.

When a sense of discomfort increased, I, as Julia taught, stretched out
my whole body and pulled my diaphragm muscle up as much as I could to
use the last air stuck in the bottom of the lungs. That gave me
another 10 or 20 seconds. Then I raised my head from the water and took a
breath. The first time I did 2:50. We started preparing for the second
attempt by breathing up. As a rule of thumb, the time at the surface
should be 2.5 to 3 times longer than the time spent under water. So
after a three-minute breath-hold we breathe for at least 6 minutes. I
did a 3:06 on the second attempt and 3:30 on the third. And that was
the end of the static session for the day.

And after dinner we took a boat and went to a place where we were told
sea turtles could be seen. But on the way we made a stop to have
another depth diving training. We dropped two lines – one on each side
of the boat. "Advanced" divers occupied one line – and we, the
dummies, the other one. During the training freedivers dive one at a time.
While one dives, the rest are waiting at the surface and breathing. And the
one who is underwater is always watched by an instructor. The practice
of freediving shows that all the troubles usually happen to freedivers
on the ascent in the upper 10 meters of water. Therefore, a stand-by
person dives to meet a rising freediver and ascends beside him,
looking into his eyes. This is to ensure that he is conscious. At the first
suspicion that something is wrong, a stand-by comes to help and pulls
a freediver to the surface.

Unfortunately, we had a chance to make only a few dives. I dove a
couple times, pulling myself down the rope. And then suddenly a strong
current appeared. I dived, finning down, and upon ascent I drifted
away from the rope. I looked up to see where I was going and saw the boat
directly above me. I started paddling away to avoid bumping my head
against the boat and suddenly found a rope. I continued my ascent
along it and upon surfacing found that it wasn't my rope, but rather the
rope on the opposite side of the boat. Because of the current it was
pointless to carry on diving; and we set off for the reef to look for
turtles.

Usually the water in this area of the Philippines is very clean and
visibility in the water is at least 15 meters. But on that day we were
unlucky: Some kind of haze was suspended in the water; and we could
see for no farther than five meters. We dispersed throughout the reef to
look for turtles, having promised to shout if anyone saw them. And I
soon spotted one. The turtle was about two feet in length. It slowly
floated at a depth of several meters; and it was accompanied by a pair
of small, needle-looking fish. I called the guys, dived, and swam
after it. The turtle noticed me, gained speed, and started escaping into the
depth. Who would have thought that that seemingly clumsy creature,
slowly paddling with its flippers, could develop such a speed? Soon I
needed to surface and had to say goodbye to the turtle. Then the guys
came by, but the turtle had already been gone. And because of poor
visibility we failed to find it again. We swam for a little longer,
then returned to the boat, pulled the anchor, and headed back to the
hotel.

Sometime later our spearfishers came back. When their boat came to
shore, our entire team gathered there to greet them. The meeting was
stormy. It looked as if the tribe was greeting their men returning
from the hunt, and, in fact, that was so. It turned out that the hunters
shot enough fish for us all. For dinner we had fried fish, fish soup,
and sashimi. And another day ended.

**The end of the sixth day.**
