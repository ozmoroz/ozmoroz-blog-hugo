On that day Julia planned filming her TV project. On the reef near
Pescador Island, where we dived a few days earlier, was an arch in the
reef under the water – "The Cathedral". The arch's entry was at 18
meters depth, and the exit at 28. Julia wanted to film herself and few
other freedivers swimming through the arch.

Therefore, in the morning we boarded the boat and went to the island.
The plan was to do some depth diving first. We arrived at the island,
cast an anchor and dropped the diving line down directly along the
wall of the reef. However, we were unlucky. There was a strong current, and
instead of going down vertically into the depth, the rope was hanging
at a 60-degree angle. Diving like that was pointless. We pulled the
weights out and tried to find a better place. Having sailed around the
island, we dropped an anchor a few hundred meters away from the reef.
There it was a little better, but the ropes were still out of plumb.
However, there was nothing we could do, and we started diving. As
always, we started with pulling ourselves down the rope by hands. I
descended to about 10 meters, and then felt that the rope I was
holding to was moving. Caught by surprise, I clung to it and was brought to
the surface. It turned out that the guys decided to re-drop the weights
and pulled  me out with them. Then the current appeared again, and the
diving became even funnier than on the previous day. While diving down
the line was still OK, on ascent you had a choice of going up holding
to the rope, which meant not directly up, or releasing the rope and
swimming straight up, surfacing wherever the current took you. A
couple of times I was carried to another side of the boat and surfaced a
dozen meters away from the place I dived. Also when ascending, I had to
continually look up to avoid bumping my head against the boat. The
last time I went on the rope down to 21 meters. Tania, who was on a
stand-by that day, told me that since I swam up and down at an angle, I could
safely assume that I dived to 25. On that the depth diving was over.
We weighed the anchor, sailed to the reef and dropped the lines in front
of the place where, at a depth of 18 meters, the entrance to "The
Cathedral" was located.

Filming underwater scenes on breath-holding is difficult – the
cameraman simply does not have enough time at the depth. Therefore,
for flexibility Julia decided to send one of our team members down with a
scuba. Andrew, himself an experienced freediving instructor, donned
scuba, took the camera and positioned himself at a depth of 24 meters
inside the arch near the entrance. Julia and Tania were diving into
the arch, and Andrew was filming them. In the meantime the others spread
out along the reef.

I floated on the surface above the arch and watched our girls diving
down. I was curious what was down there. I took a deep breath and
dived. Of course I didn't go into the arch – I'm not crazy – and have
a very strong sense of self-preservation. Moreover, I didn't want to
dive deeply without somebody watching me. But nevertheless, I very
comfortably dove down to a depth where I could see the edge of the
hole in the reef and Andrew sitting there with a scuba a few meters below
me. I did not have a computer, which shows the depth and time
intervals, so I did not know how deep that was, but I reckon about 15
meters. At this depth, my buoyancy was already neutral; I could hang
there for some time looking around without moving a muscle. It was
very beautiful there. I was hanging in the water column, and right in front
of me the reef wall was stretched from surface into the depths.
Underwater coral forests played all shades of emerald green in the sun
rays penetrating from the surface. Julia and Tania swam past me along
the rope and disappeared inside the arch. I hung there for a few more
seconds and rose to the surface. I dived a few more times and found
that such a depth was quite comfortable to me. It is a pity that I did
not have a dive computer. When I depart on such a journey once again,
I will certainly buy one.

On that the filming was over and we returned to the hotel. It was about
five o'clock in the evening and everyone was hungry, because shooting
dragged on, and we were left without a lunch. While we waited for
dinner, Vasily suggested that I try to swim in his monofin – we had
the same foot size. As I said, monofin is a blade in the form of a
mermaid's tail, with attached pockets for both feet. The foot pockets
themselves are of unusual shape and the foot inside them is bent in a
special way, which is very uncomfortable but provides better
performance.

A monofin was invented in the 70s in the Soviet Union by
fin-swimming athletes. They became popular in the rest of the world
thanks to Jacques Mayol, who received one during his visit to the
Soviet Union from the inventor himself, fin-swimmer coach Boris
Porotov. These days monofins are not something extraordinary. They are
manufactured in a number of countries. But the best ones are still
Russian and they are made individually to order. A monofin is much more
efficient than traditional fins; however, it has its disadvantages. It
does not offer the same manoeuvrability as traditional fins. And it's
not the best choice if it needs to be used for a few hours in a row:
foot pockets are so uncomfortable that after some time swimming they
start to hurt.

Swimming in a monofin was a pretty interesting experience. The small
pool did not allow us to develop great speed, but still the power was
amazing: three strokes with a "tail", and 10 meters were behind. Even
with my practically nonexistent dolphin-style swimming technique. I
certainly liked that. I probably would have bought one for myself, but
I clearly understood that I didn't need one yet. I didn't know where I
could use it. I wouldn't buy it to swim just in a pool, and I would
freeze in Port Phillip Bay. With our water temperature, we need to
choose the fins in such a way that they could be put on a 3mm neoprene
sock.

After dinner, Julia continued to read us freediving theory.

Modern freediving competitions are held in several disciplines: diving
to a depth, lengthwise in the pool (dynamic apnoea) with fins and
without fins, and the static breath-hold. Currently, man has learned
to hold his breath for more than 11 minutes and swim with fins underwater
for 250 meters in a pool. But the most interesting competitions are on
diving into the depths. They are divided into several types:
Free Immersion – where an athlete dives without fins and pulls himself
up and down the line with his hands.
Constant Weight with or without fins – an athlete swims down and up without touching the rope.
Variable Weight – an athlete dives down with extra weight, and at a
depth releases it and uses his fins to ascend.
No Limits. Here an athlete holds on to a special weighted platform – a
sled – as it carries him along to the depths. At the moment the
deepest
dive in this category is 214 meters. Coming up to the surface from
such
depths just by using a muscular force is unthinkable, and that's why
special aids are used. At the deepest point a freediver unleashes a
gas-filled float, which then pulls him up. Such an extreme is not for
everyone, and not just because of the enormous depth.

{{<figure src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WHX6BjxVdn0/S5t3qmc7Q2I/AAAAAAAADA8/H28sSfZMFbg/s960-Ic42/SANY0005.JPG" caption="Club Serena's pool">}}

In this kind of competition an athlete's life depends on technical aids, which can
fail. In the history of the competitions, there were several deaths
and near-death cases occurred because of equipment: a jammed sled, or a
valve of a gas tank not opening. And yet, there are still people who
beat those records.

Constant weight with fins is considered the most classical discipline
and a highlight of any competition. Here an athlete dives into the
depth, counting only on himself. He is one-on-one with the abyss.
According to current competition rules, an athlete must declare the
depth at which he is going to dive in advance. At that depth a plate
with the corresponding number is fixed. The athlete has to grab the
plate and show it to the judges upon surfacing. In addition, a depth
gauge on the wrist registers the depth. But just reaching the depth
isn't sufficient. It is necessary to pass the surface protocol, which
states that a freediver must be in full consciousness and behave
adequately. If an athlete breaches any of these requirements, he is
disqualified.

It's not entirely clear to me why people take part in such competitions
and beat records. Any "big" sport brings pain and traumas. As for me
right now, I dive into depth, but not for depth. Yes, I am curious to
know what I am capable of, but I would never dive to a depth that is
uncomfortable to me. While diving, we submerge into ourselves, and
that is the only thing that matters.
