They say every man goes through a midlife crisis. They used to be associated with flashy purchases like fast cars or motorbikes. But recently a new trend started to emerge. Generation X men coming into a mid-age increasingly choose carbon fibre bicycles over Porsches. This is in part because of the financial pressure - <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/">there has been no real wage growth over the last few decades</a>, and at the same time, a larger proportion of the income needs to be allocated towards mortgage payments and other living expenses. Besides, men are chasing their youth, which is the essence of a midlife crisis, while Porsches are frowned upon as a sign of old age since only older men can afford them.

But every man is different. I honestly thought that my midlife crisis was behind me without any flashy manifestations. Well, I bought a red car ten years ago but it doesn't count (sort of, right?). As for a bicycle, I have never been a bike person. I had a decent bicycle, but I barely rode it, and most of the time it was just idly sitting in my garage. Moreover, a geek should have a special kind of geeky midlife crisis, or otherwise, what's the fun in it?

A month ago I was at <a href="http://www.tge.melbourne/">Technology &amp; Gadget Expo</a> in Melbourne where I saw a booth with electric skateboards. I rode skateboards a little bit when I was a teenager 25 years ago. Back then in Russia, we didn't know the difference between the skateboards and longboards, we just rode whatever we could get a hold of. Although I wasn't very good at it, skateboards since had a special place in my heart. But that passion just laid dormant inside of me.

A few years ago, when I read about Boosted boards and then sometime later saw a Boosted Gen 2 board in an office of a bank where I worked at the time (I still don't know whose board that was). Although I felt I was getting hooked, it still seemed a distant dream. Electric boards were rare as unicorns, and the price was prohibitive.

So, when I arrived at the Tech &amp; Gadget Expo 2017 I was quite surprised to find that one of the dominating themes were the electric vehicles. There were <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segways</a>, electric scooters, bicycles and, my favourite, skateboards. In fact, there were not one but 4 different e-skateboard booths: <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/">Evolve</a>, <a href="https://www.bajaboard.com.au/">BajaBoard</a>, <a href="http://jedboards.com/">JedBoard</a> and <a href="https://www.fiik.com/">Fiik</a>. At the centre of the exhibition hall was a test drive area where a willing audience could try to ride on electric vehicles. One part of the test drive area was dedicated to Segways and bicycles, and the other one - to skateboards. I ignored the Segways and decided to try an e-board.

The first board a stepped on was an <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/bamboo-gtx-series/products/bamboo-gtx-series-street?variant=37308279625">Evolve GTX Bamboo</a>.  It felt awkward at first, but after a few minutes, I got hooked. That was on Saturday. I went home but came back on the next day. I tried to ride on an Evolve again, this time with <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/bamboo-gtx-series/products/bamboo-gtx-series-all-terrain?variant=37308440265">all-terrain wheels</a>, and on a <a href="http://jedboards.com/">Jedboard</a>. As inexperienced with skateboards as I am, they felt nearly same to me, however, I still liked the Evolve a touch better. Besides, I couldn't buy a Jedboard straight away: they only had pre-production samples at the expo. They promised to deliver the boards in November - December but required a deposit.

Not without hesitation I finally succumbed and decided to buy an Evolve board. Because I was new to electric skateboarding I decided to go for a simple option first. I wanted to see if I would like it or not before pouring lots of money into it. I chose a <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/bamboo-gt-series/products/bamboo-gt-series-street?variant=28553138249">Bamboo GT Street version</a> but opted for the <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/wheels/products/black-evolve-gt-97mm-76a-stone-ground-set-of-4">largest street wheels - 97mm</a>. Big wheels glide smoother over rough surfaces and they allow rolling easily over cracks and small potholes. Oh, and I bought an Evolve helmet too.

A few days later I took the board out. I chose a <a href="http://thehumblevintage.com/suggested-route-daytime/">bicycle trail which goes along Half Moon Bay</a> as my testing ground. God, it felt so awkward first! I didn't know how to step on the board, how to start moving. The acceleration and braking felt brutal, and the board literally tried to jump out from under my feet. I had to jump off the board at the first sight of an approaching pothole or a road crossing. But the longer I rode on it, the better it felt. After about half an hour I started picking up speed and rolling over curbs with (some) confidence. Riding the board felt natural to me. Before I noticed I made it all the way from Brighton to Port Melbourne (10km) and then back. The fastest I went on the straight was 20 km/h and it started to feel a bit scary at that speed. I still had 40% of the battery left after my trip.

That is the story of my first ride on an electric skateboard. I got hooked. I can't wait to ride it again soon.
