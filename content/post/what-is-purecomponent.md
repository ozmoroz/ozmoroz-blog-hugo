React 15.3 introduced [`PureComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcomponent) - a new way of implementing class-based components. It is now available to us alongside function-based components and components derived from `React.Component`.

This new technique caused much confusion in React rounds. Is `PureComponent` a new improved version of `React.Compoment`? Does it automatically make everything better? Should you just slap PureComponent everywhere and enjoy your faster React app?

### What is PureComponent

`PureComponent` is a base class for React class-based components. It implements [shouldComponentUpdate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate) lifecycle method like this:

```javascript
return (
  !shallowEqual(oldProps, newProps) ||
  !shallowEqual(oldState, newState)
);
```

It checks whether the *state* or *props* changed using **shallow equality comparison**.

**If the props and the state hasn't changed, the component is not re-rendered.**

> `shallowEqual` performs a shallow equality check by iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning true when the values of a key in each object are not strictly equal.
> Source: [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/shallow-compare.html)

`PureComponent` is an advanced optimisation technique. *Optimisation* because it has a potential to make your application faster. *Advanced* because it can also break your app if you are not careful.

To use `PureComponent` simply derive your class-based component from `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`.

```javascript
class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  ...
}
```

### Why to use PureComponent

Both [functional-based and class-based components](https://ozmoroz.com/2018/08/react-functional-vs-class-components/) have the same downside: they **always re-render when their parent component re-renders even if the props don't change**.

Also, class-based components **always re-render when its state is updated** (`this.setState` is called) **even if the new state is equal to the old state**.

**Moreover, when a parent component re-renders, all of its children are also re-rendered, and their children too, and so on.**

That behaviour may mean a lot of wasted re-renderings. Indeed, if our component only depends on its props and state, then it shouldn't re-render if neither of them changed, no matter what happened to its parent component.

That is precisely what PureComponent does - it stops the vicious re-rendering cycle. PureComponent does not re-render unless its props and state change.

### Caveats

#### 1. State and Props immutability

Since the props and state equality is checked via a *shallow equality*, PureComponent **only works if its props and state are immutable**. That is, if you pass an object prop into a component derived from `React.Purecomponent`,  you should always create a new prop object on every change instead of modifying its values. The same with a state - always create a new state within `this.setState` call instead of changing the existing one. If you don't, then shallow equality won't be able to detect the change, and your component won't re-render when it needs to.

*[This article by Niels Gerritsen explains immutable objects very well](https://wecodetheweb.com/2016/02/12/immutable-javascript-using-es6-and-beyond/)*

#### 2. shouldComponentUpdate

If you plan to implement your own `shouldComponentUpdate` in your component, then you can't use `React.PureComponent` as a base. If you do, you will get error "*shouldComponentUpdate should not be used when extending React.PureComponent. Please extend React.Component if shouldComponentUpdate is used.*"

### When to use PureComponent

To sum it up, `PureComponent` is useful when:

- You want to avoid re-rendering cycles of your component when its props and state are not changed, and
- The state and props of your component are immutable, and
- You don't plan to implement your own `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method.

On the other hand, you should not use `PureComponent` as a base for you component if:

- Your props or state are not immutable, or
- You plan to implement your own `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method.
